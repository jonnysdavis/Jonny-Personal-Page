# NeuroPlant

It was challenging to focus on the soldering iron in front of me when she was in the room. Lorraine’s waist-length mocha hair cascaded down her face, and I couldn’t help but gaze whenever she absentmindedly brushed it behind her ear. Unfortunately, this almost led to a collision with the liquid metal in front of me.

“Shit. That was close.” A piece of molten liquid had almost come into contact with my finger.

“What happened this time? Too busy daydreaming?”

“Something like that.”

Lorraine couldn't catch me stealing glances because her sense of sight was stolen after head trauma from a car accident caused cortical blindness in both her eyes. Despite this disadvantage, she worked with us in the University's Neuro-Computer Science Lab.

Although she wasn’t able to see the arrays of drawers attached to every bit of drywall or the costly equipment filling the desk space, we worked together to make the lab accessible to her. This began with a crude solution in which the students would retrieve electronics and tools for her upon request, but it quickly advanced. Lorraine began wearing an ultrasonic belt. Its haptic feedback alerted her to nearby obstacles. A robotic hand attached to the ceiling used its metal fingers to grasp items and bring them to her. Originally intended for Lorraine, the entire lab enjoyed its use. It was even featured on the front page of the student run newspaper.

“Have you heard about the new model of the NeuroPlant?” she asked, as nudging her hair behind her ear again.

“Yup, they just released the next version or something.”

“Well, I talked to Dr. Celestine, and the lab is paying for me to get one.”

I was surprised to hear that news. NeuroPlant’s neural interface allowed it to send electrical signals to the brain. I wanted one myself, but I couldn’t afford to buy one.

“What’s the plan?” I hoped that my supportive tone would mask my jealousy. 

“Dr. Celestine was discussing something about--”

“--Vision signals?” I interjected.

“Not too surprised you guessed it.” It dawned on me that this might mean I would not be able to steal glances as often.

“Are you O.K with being, uh, experimented on?” I cringed at my phrasing, but was relieved to see a bright smile overtake her previously straight face.

“O.K with it? I’m excited!” 

I made as much small talk as I could before exchanging goodbyes, then immediately made my way over to Dr. Celestine’s office. I knocked on the thin feeling pine door, and stepped in as soon as invited.

“Mr. Layne, it’s nice to see you. What can I help you with?” he asked into the dark grey beard covering the majority of his face.

“Please, like I’ve said, you can call me Royce. I wanted to talk to you about switching projects.”

“Oh? To what?”

“The NeuroPlant vision project.”

He shot me a thin smile. Almost everyone in the lab had guessed I had a soft spot for Lorraine, except for Lorraine herself. I had at least hoped that our professor hadn’t noticed, but I seemed to be wrong.

“On one condition,” the professor asserted.

“And that is?”

“The team converting signals for the visual cortex already has too many people. It’s a high profile project. You’d have to take a different angle. Research tonight, and come back to me tomorrow with a proposal. If I deem it worthwhile, you’ll be allowed to switch.”

“Thanks for the opportunity. I’ll begin right away.” The gears in my mind were already turning.

Walking straight to my desk in the shared office, I was so lost in thought that those who passed by me received unreciprocated greetings. I also almost walked into a cleaned glass door...but that’s beside the point.

I swiped my key card to get into the room and jogged over to my computer. Those who shared the room with me tended to find my perfectly clean desk topped with three large computer monitors to be a bit off-putting. Conducting academic research was normally one of the most dull parts of my graduate studies, I much preferred building things, but this was one of the first times I was excited to investigate a topic.

I studied the plans for the eye replication model. My calculations brought me to the same conclusion that the rest of the team had reached: processing and sending the correct signal would be extremely difficult and would take unprecedented amounts of computing power. 

I remembered the first time I built something for Lorraine. She loved playing the cult-favorite WordCraft, but couldn’t play after her loss of sight. I created a program that read the responses of the game back to the player, and then used the player’s voice to transmit the response back to the machine. She gave me the warmest hug afterwards. I’ve been hooked on her since.

The memory of our shared fondness of the game led me to an interesting thought: Sending images to the brain the same way eyes do it is extremely difficult, but what about text? Lorraine once had the ability to read text on a page, so maybe I could start with that. Not quite as impressive as giving sight back to the blind, but affording Loraine the ability to read standard text would be quite a feat.

After many long phone calls with my peers in the neuroscience and neurobiology programs, they agreed -- at least in theory -- that one could neurologically mimic the biological signals that text creates in the brain. This meant I could bypass having to recreate the complex visual electrical signals the other team was working on. Fueled by stale coffee and sour energy drinks, I continued to work until I had something to share with my professor. Sometime around midnight, I had a welcome interruption.

“I brought you some chicken from the faculty dinner in case you haven’t eaten yet. I microwaved it first, don’t worry!” I didn’t notice her walk in, so hearing her warm voice gave me a jolt of energy. The fact she brought me food doubled this second wind.

I thanked her while accepting the Styrofoam plate, sure that its flavor would be mediocre at best, but so pleased that she had been so thoughtful.

“No problem. What are you working on so late anyways?” She leaned in inquisitively.

“Oh, uh, you know, grant papers and such.” I lied, hoping to preserve the surprise. 

“I know the feeling. Good luck!” She spun around on her heel and quickly yet carefully followed her belt out the door.

I continued my research until eventually I had enough done to prove that it should be possible, at least in theory. I needed to make sure that a standard computer could convert text to the proper electrical signal, and that the NeuroPlant would be able to send the information. Excitedly, I found out that this would take significantly less computing power compared to the other team. 

A spill of my coffee told me it was time for bed. Looking at the clock, I realized the night had passed and it was already four in the morning. I decided to get what little sleep I could right there at my desk.

I was awoken by the sound of the doctoral candidates arriving at the shared office space. The bags under my eyes told me it was time to drink more coffee to get the day started, and I begrudgingly followed their instructions. With a not-so-fresh cup of Joe in hand, I proceeded to print out my research and calculations and head for Dr. Celestine’s office.

“Mr. Layne, I’m assuming you brought some research to present?”

“Royce, and yes. Instead of mimicking the eyes, I want to mimic the reading of text.”

“Interesting. Let me see.”

I handed him a stack of unstapled papers to examine. Hopefully he wouldn't notice the coffee stain on my right leg from last night.

“So, Dr. Celestine, I plan to--”

“I’m reading Mr. Layne. One moment.”

I sat there in an uncomfortable silence, constantly bouncing my foot on the floor.  I was afraid to look at my cell phone in fear of seeming rude. Minutes passed, then he finally spoke.

“Only a fraction of the complexity? Interesting. Make it happen.”

I was so excited that I almost forgot to thank him as I nearly ran back to my desk. This time I made sure to dodge the pristinely clean glass door. After downloading the NeuroPlant simulator, I got to work on writing the software to make this possible.

The following week, Lorraine successfully got the NeuroPlant surgically implanted. I felt as though I needed to talk to her about it, but they may be because I felt like I needed to talk to her in general.  My software was almost ready, but I needed more time before I felt confident enough to show it to her. I ran into her in the graduate student lounge.

“So, how is it?”

“Honestly? I feel like nothing’s changed. It doesn’t come with any software anyway. Some legal issues or something, who knows? The basic stuff I’ve found online is fun.”

“I’m excited to see what the group makes for it.”

“Me too! Should be awesome,” she replied, flashing me a smile.

I pulled another near all-nighter in order to finish a prototype of what I was building, and was pleasantly surprised once I saw the application working properly within the NeuroPlant simulator. I couldn't wait to see what Lorraine thought. I woke up the next morning after one or two hours of sleep with my cheek glued to my keyboard.  The growing string of useless characters in my text editor let me know I had been in this position since I accidently fell asleep while my code was compiling.

My eagerness to show Lorraine overcame my grogginess from the poor sleep my keyboard offered.  I looked for Lorraine and found her in the hardware lab, and nervously approached her. 

“Hey Lorraine, I built something that I want you to try.” As I watched her bite her lip while concentrating on what was in front of her, the anxious feeling that had been growing in the pit of my stomach began to cool.

“What’s that?”

“It’s for your NeuroPlant. A way to read text.”

“Royce, I had no idea you were working on this! The other team’s project hasn’t been working out very well. When do I get to try it?” I could hear the excitement bubbling in her voice, and the pressure for my project to work almost made me too nervous to show it to her.

“Right now, if you’re ready.”

“Let’s go for it.” She walked me through connecting the NeuroPlant to my computer so that I could run the crude program I had worked so hard to build.

“Are you ready?” 

“Of course I am. Just do it!”

I typed in the text “HELLO WORLD” into the input box, and hesitantly brought my mouse over to the submit button.  Deciding it was too late to back out, I activated the program.

There was a pause, and the room was silent. I had never seen Lorraine so still. Her jaw dropped slightly.

“So, did it wo--”

I stopped talking when I saw her jolt out of her seat, and turned towards me. She wrapped her arms around me, holding me close to her. The room stayed nearly silent as we stood, embracing one another.

“Royce, it’s... it’s… beautiful,” she shakily explained. For a moment she hid her hair behind her face and I heard a soft sniffle.

“What does it look like?” 

She could barely respond because she was still so excited from the image being painted into her mind’s eye.

“I need to sit down first.”

“Sure, let me get you a chair.”

“I’m sorry, what did you ask?”  She sat in the chair I brought over and exhaled with relief.

“What does it look like? The text I mean.”

“Crisp white text on a black background. It’s rather huge honestly. Royce, this is amazing!” 

A wide smile appeared on my face, but not quite as wide as the one on hers. We spent the rest of the day experimenting with different phrases and differing amounts of text. We realized that, with training, a user would be able to see multiple lines of text at once. I then loaded her favorite game, WordCraft, and loaded the text simulator. An infectious laugh escaped Lorraine’s mouth. She gently placed her hand on my upper leg while she played the text based game with me as her spectator. I got to watch the game unfold on the computer screen in front of me. Unfortunately, images in the game were unable to  render properly. One game turned into two, and two to three. We spent hours alone, secluded together in the lab. The faint hums of the machines in the background provided the music, and the LED lighting provided the ambiance. Once we grew tired of the game, she turned off the NeuroPlant.

“That’s enough for now. This whole experience has been overwhelming.” The happiness in her voice made me want to make up any reason to keep her here.

“There’s one last thing I want to try. Do you mind?”

“I owe you that much.”

She powered up the NeuroPlant again and I connected it to my program. I copied in a strange looking face.

 “(ﾉ◕ヮ◕)ﾉ.”

“All I see are parentheses? What’s going on?”

She could only recognize characters she’s seen before. The pieces from other languages were unfamiliar to her. I typed in a classic smiley face, one formed from a colon and a parenthesis.

“How about now?”

“A smiley face! Very cute, Royce.”

“That’s all I wanted to try. I’ll let you get some rest now. This must have been a lot!”

We stood up in unison and Lorraine generously offered another hug. As soon as she left, I began to prepare a manual for her on how to use the program. As I walked back to my desk, an idea struck me. If she could see multiple lines of text at once, maybe I could send her something that looked like a picture. I opened a word processor and began to experiment.

It was unimpressive, but a fun way of creating different fonts. This system probably wouldn’t be worthwhile in comparison to the text that the program makes originally, but it led to another idea.

      _|/^\
      (_oo /\
      /-|--/\

      /--i\

It was another basic image, but it was a proof of concept. I could send a picture to her through text. I sat at my desk to create a program that would help her train to see multiple lines of text simultaneously, since that was the only way to make this plan work It took the rest of the day to build this functionality. I knew I should go speak with Dr. Celestine for some interim feedback, but decided it was more important to plow ahead while I was focused. I sent the new version to the team, along with a basic manual. 

Before going to bed, I took out a notepad and wrote down what I wanted to accomplish next: “User wears camera. Turn video feed into text. Send to user.” It was hard to sleep when I was this excited with new ideas. I ended up sleeping on the couch so I would be able to start as soon as I woke up.

Once again, I started my day with the lab’s coffee, which at this point didn’t seem so bad. I found an algorithm for turning images into text, and disabled any characters that Lorraine would likely be unable to recognize. I connected a webcam to my computer and linked it with the algorithm found earlier. The only issue was that the speed of the algorithm only allowed me to send one image every five seconds with the computing power available in the NeuroPlant. Regardless, it was a start.

After another week passed, Lorraine told me that she had maxed out the training program. In the time it took her to complete the training, I had figured out how to interface a pair of video recording sunglasses with the NeuroPlant. I again ran into her in the lab and was immediately flooded with fond memories of the last time we were here together.

“Royce, you won’t believe how much I’ve been reading.”

“I thought something like that may happen, I’m glad you’re being productive!”

“Something like that,” she humbly replied.

“Would you mind going for a walk? Just want to test how it works outside.”

“I assume it’d be the same Royce. What would change?”

“Hopefully nothing, but it’s just part of the research.” I fibbed, wanting to surprise her with my real intentions.

We quickly left the lab and I guided her towards the campus mall.  A silent disabling of her ultrasonic belt let me know that she trusted my lead  I was excited for her to see how it actually looked, with the long stretch of grass surrounded by buildings and a fountain in the center. The fresh spring air drew the other students outside, it seems as though I couldn't have picked a better day.

We arrived at the bottom of the mall and I asked her to put on the modified sunglasses I brought with me. She was hesitant about removing her own, but I assured her that these were tinted just as much. As she replaced her glasses with the ones I gave to her, she looked away so I wouldn’t be able to see her damaged eyes. I wish she knew that I didn’t mind. She also took a moment to re enable the belt around her waist. I connected her new glasses to her NeuroPlant and began the program.

She stood there silently, stunned obviously amazed by what she could now see. I reached for her hand beside me, and on contact hers grabbed onto mine without hesitation.

“Royce, I… I need to lie down.”

We lay next to one another on the grass, and I couldn’t wait for the image to update to the sky above her.

![886183874e784581d430befb5e712f00.png](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXeR_RH_bNmNig3Cie5SeqaKIZJC698tbfYSrclUsbM5_fD0gk6QyEuQrH7lp6hLZ-CPtS6EOtryurNEgHuTMZtRnwWsmIz0Yu9Nvuy3j9Cu4UvxmhKm86I-a-BlF10YpqLuYIHwbX1YrvALwseDsXkTQwSCxqesl1bp?key=dmDQq41B9F9qnDHO4fTfPw)

“Royce, I’m speechless.”

“That’s alright. Let’s just stay here for a minute.”

Together we stared at the clouds passing overhead. Even though it was something we had both seen before, in this moment it was like seeing them for the first time. We stayed there together in a silent moment that I never wanted to end. The faint buzz from her belt was strangely alluring, letting me know that I was near her. As time passed we moved closer to one another slowly, as if the other wouldn’t notice. I decided to break the silence.

“What’s it look like?”

“Shut up,” she said, as she leaned in close to me and nudged my arm.  She pressed her lips against mine, and we shared our first kiss.
